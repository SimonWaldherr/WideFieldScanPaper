\section{Summary and Outlook}
\label{sec:summary}\label{sec:outlook}

The proposed method establishes an increase of the visible FOV up to five times what is conventionally available. We have shown that we can provide different scanning protocols based on needs of the end-user of TOMCAT. The end-user has the possibility to choose a suitable scanning protocol depending on a balance between acquisition time and reconstruction quality. \cbstart Depending on this balance, \cbend we manage to reduce the image acquisition time down to \SI{14}{\percent} of the comparable gold standard scan while keeping the quality of the reconstructed tomographic dataset on a level that still permitted automated segmentation of the lung structure and surrounding airspace, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:BvsT}.

Further increases of the FOV are only theoretically limited, but face problems with the amount of data to process. The dataset shown in figure~\ref{fig:LungSlabSophie} is composed of 1024 tiff-Files each with a size of 4852$\times$4852 pixels, which adds up to a total size of nearly \SI{23}{\giga B}. Calculations and visualizations of datasets of this size require great optimizations of the processing queue and automation of calculations.

\cbstart
A method to increase the FOV of tomographic imaging has been established. The established method enable the high-resolution tomographic imaging of relatively big samples---bigger than the FOV of the imaging setup---in multiple steps, which are automated into one tool chain. In our case, this makes it possible to visualize entire acini, inside rat lung samples, something which is not easily possible with the conventional tomographic setup present at TOMCAT.
\cbend

In addition to the multiple scans of the same sample to assess the method, we also recorded tomographic datasets with increased FOV from distal-medial edges of right lower lung lobes of Sprague Dawley rats obtained at post-natal days 4, 10, 21, 36 and 60. With these samples we have begun to study the skeleton of the terminal airways to quantitatively differentiate the lung development at this post-natal stage\todo{or don't we tell this, since it's another story?}.
