\section{Discussion}\label{sec:Discussion}

We present a method to laterally increase the field of view of tomographic imaging systems operated in parallel beam geometry and would like to call this method wide field synchrotron radiation based x-ray tomographic microscopy (WF-SRXTM). We defined scanning protocols for the optimization of the total imaging time versus the expected imaging quality, enabling a very fast acquisition of lower quality tomographic datasets, or acquisition of very high quality datasets in a longer time.

Even if the reduction in scanning time does introduce minor artifacts in the three-dimensional reconstruction, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BvsT}, an automated segmentation of the relevant features in the sample is still possible, even for protocols with greatly reduced scanning time. 

Additionally, shortening the scanning time also reduces the radiation damage even though, for this study, this was not an issue. Obviously, a reduction of the imparted dose to the sample is crucial when radiation sensitive sample are investigated. With a
suitable protocol the dose can be reduced by \SI{84}{\percent} (Table~\ref{tab:protocols}), which might be a significant step towards tomographic imaging of sensitive samples using ultra high resolution and enhanced field of view. 

The field of view was increased three-fold by merging projections from three partially overlapping scans and reconstructing these resulting projections using the standard workflow at the TOMCAT beamline (Figure~\ref{fig:wide-field-scan-results}). As a consequence of the sampling theorem, an increased amount of projections had to be acquired, thus increasing the acquisition time. To overcome this limitation, we defined multiple scanning protocols with a reduced amount of total projections and thus reduced acquisition time and delivered dose (Table~\ref{tab:protocols}). All of these protocols were evaluated for the quality of the resulting reconstructions and compared to a gold standard scan. We have shown that the resulting quality can be simulated prior to scanning and thus provide a tool to choose a suited scanning protocol, based on the demands for scanning time optimization and quality of the resulting tomographic dataset (Figure~\ref{fig:NormalizedErrorPlot}). 

Reducing the amount of projections for the central of the three subscans may be performed with a minor loss of fidelity in the resulting reconstructions. Let us compare protocols D/E and H/I. For protocols E and I we acquired half the amount of projections for the central subscan $\textrm{s}_{2}$ as compared to protocols D and H. In both cases we reduce the scanning time by \SI{17}{\percent}, but keep the quality of the scan on a comparable level (D: $\SI{70}{\percent}\pm3.09$ vs. E: $\SI{80}{\percent}\pm3.01$, H: $\SI{60}{\percent}\pm8.08$ vs. I: $\SI{56}{\percent}\pm3.23$).
% B--C = 13110/15732 = 0.8333, 100%--89%
% D--E = 10925/13110 = 0.8333, 85%--87%
% H--I = 8740/10488 = 0.8303; 78%--80%
We show that the interpolation of missing projections does not introduce relevant errors in the resulting tomographic datasets.

For protocols with an equal amount of total projections, but differing amount of projections for the individual subscans (C/D and M/N) we observed minor differences in reconstruction quality. The qualities $E_{i_{norm}}$ of protocols C and D lie within their respective standard deviation ($\SI{74}{\percent}\pm6.81$ vs. $\SI{70}{\percent}\pm3.09$), and the qualities of protocols M and N are comparable ($\SI{52}{\percent}\pm4.71$ vs. $\SI{42}{\percent}\pm4.78$). Both protocols C and M are scanned without oversampling the central subscan, making interpolation necessary, for protocols D and N we simply stitched the projections of the three subscans. Note that for protocol N we do undersample the outer parts of the sample. When deciding between two protocols with the same amount of total projections, it is thus desirable to favor the protocol where the central scan is not oversampled (i.\,e. choosing protocol C instead of D). Even if this introduces additional computing time to interpolate projections prior to reconstruction, these protocols show an increased quality compared to protocols where the central scan is oversampled. Since an oversampling of the central scan does not add much to the total reconstruction quality and the outer parts of the sample contribute more to the total area of the projections, choosing a protocol where the sampling theorem is satisfied better for those parts of the sample is favorable (i.\,e. favouring protocol M to protocol N).

With the defined protocols we open the possibility for the end-user to choose an acquisition mode suited to fulfill the constraints on number of samples to be scanned within the allocated beamtime and desired quality of the reconstructed datasets.

Additionally, two special use-cases for different protocols are worth mentioning. First, if the user needs a very quick overview over samples at high resolution, a time-saving protocol can be used. This is especially the case, if the integrity of the sample can only be judged with a tomographic scan. Based on the quick scan the right samples for high resolution scans may be selected. It has to be mentioned that a quick overview could---in principle---be obtained with a low-resolution scan, which usually automatically accommodates a larger field of view. However, the resolution of such an overview scan is not always sufficient to detect interesting features in the samples which might be damaged.

We have shown that the field of view of parallel beam tomographic end-stations can be increased up to five-fold and have routinely reconstructed multiple tomograms with a three-fold increase in field of view. The shown acquisition protocols are theoretically expandable for more than five subscans, although the reconstruction of wide field scans with seven or more subscans would require an extremely powerful data processing infrastructure. The datasets shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BvsT} are binned scans resulting in datasets of 1024 slices, each with a size of 2792$\times$2792 pixels at \SI{8}{\bit} gray value depth, which adds up to a total size of the dataset of approximately \SI{7.5}{\giga\byte}. If we assume an unbinned scan with seven overlapping subscans, the size of one stitched projection will be approximately 14000$\times$14000 pixels. The full dataset will consist of 2048 such slices, which would add up to a total size for the full dataset of approximately \SI{383}{\giga\byte}.

Even if the amount of data to handle is huge, a wide field scan with a five-fold increase in field of view remains interesting, since it would enable the end-user to selectively reconstruct only regions of interest from large samples with ultra-high resolution. Up to now, a two-step process was required to scan precisely defined regions from samples larger than the field of view. This process involved the use of different magnifications, two separate beamtimes and a precise registration of the samples between those beamtimes.
