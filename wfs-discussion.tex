\section{Discussion}
We found this:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Problems with insufficient sampling for outer subscans?
	\item Stitching takes long time (incorporation into \verb+prj2sin+ and \verb+sin2rec+ @ beamline?)
	\item MATLAB \& Python-Script prior to imaging
	\begin{itemize}
		\item integration with robot $>$ potentially eliminating any user intervention with sample placement.
	\end{itemize}
	\item automatically scanning all subscans, no user intervention.
	\item MATLAB-stitching after imaging
	\item RecoManager
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \verb+gridrec+-Problem solved?
	\end{itemize}
	\item Wide Field Scan is doable
	\item for smallish samples (up to 5 subscans) well suited
	\begin{itemize}
		\item if samples are unbinned, even 5 subscans are too big, R243B06a\_merge (with merged .tifs of a size of 9703$\times$2048 pixels) has not been reconstructed due to RecoManager-\verb+gridrec+-size-Problems.
	\end{itemize}
	\item for bigger samples ($>$ 7 subscans) amount of data is too big to handle (2048 rec.tifs with potential sizes of 14000$\times$14000 px) to be able to reconstruct one full sample with full resolution.
	\item thus partial ROI-reconstruction $>$ extraction of ROI from RecoManager and then reconstruct only this Region. Partial stitching of sinograms, padding them to the correct size, correct RotCenter for this sinogram $>$ reconstruction of small size.
	\item Would potentially solve "problem" with ROI-Picker, where one needs two allotted beam-times to achieve this. First, overview scan, then pick ROI, then detailed scan. With this method, full dataset is obtained in one scan, then partial reconstructions can be done.
\end{itemize}
