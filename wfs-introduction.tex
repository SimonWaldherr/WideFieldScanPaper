\section{Introduction}
Synchrotron radiation based x-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) is a powerful method for the non-destructive three-dimensional imaging of a broad kind of materials with a resolution on the sub-micrometer scale.

At TOMCAT---the beamline for TOmographic Microscopy and Coherent rAdiology experimenTs~\cite{Stampanoni2007} at the Swiss Light Source (SLS), Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland---more than 20 user groups are presently working in diverse research areas, ranging from biology, medicine and paleontology to materials science, geology and process engineering\todo{citations?}. SRXTM enables the user to have a qualitative and quantitative measurement and analysis of nearly any structure.

\subsection{Background}
Various applications depend on the availability of high resolution tomographic images of the studied sample. The available field of view (FOV) of microscopy based imaging methods like synchrotron based tomographic beam lines and micro-computed tomography (\micro CT) stations is limited by the camera and microscope optics. To be able to obtain images with a broad FOV one has to use lower magnifications to cover bigger samples.

To record tomographic datasets at TOMCAT with a resolution of around \SI{1}{\micro\meter}, the sample diameter has to be below \SI{1}{\milli\meter}. This constraint can be overcome with so called local tomography, where the sample diameter is bigger than the FOV, but this a) introduces image artifacts at the edges of the reconstructed slices and b) does not solve the need for tomographic datasets with high resolution and large lateral FOV.

\subsection{Motivation}
\label{subsec:motivation}
At our group we have been studying lung development~\cite{Schittny2008,Mund2008} and lung structure~\cite{Tsuda2008} using SRXTM. Until now, the investigation of the three dimensional structure of an entire acinus---the functional lung unit---was either limited by the resolution of the imaging method (in the case of \micro CT) or the sample volume (in the case of SRXTM). We developed a synchrotron radiation x-ray tomographic microscopy method to combine several tomographic scans into one large three dimensional dataset to increase the scanned volume by a factor of nine in the simple and up to a factor of 25 in the advanced case.

\subsection{Enhancing the Field of View}
\label{subsec:enhancing the field of view}
An increase of the FOV parallel to the rotation axis of the sample can be achieved through the stacking of multiple scans on top of each other. This stacking has been implemented at TOMCAT through accurately controlling the end-station setup and sample position.

This means that the final reconstructions can simply be stacked on top of each other, even if they have been acquired in different scans. For this imaging mode, the scanning time linearly increases with the sample size.

If the FOV horizontal to the rotation axis of the sample is to be increased, the projections cannot simply be merged together, since the sampling theorem implies some restrictions, which are detailed below.

Generally, to be able to accurately reconstruct a sample, we have to fulfill the sampling theorem for computed tomography. \citet{Kak2002} stated that for parallel beam tomography: \begin{quote} The number of projections should be roughly equal to the number of rays in each projection. \end{quote} In our case the number of rays corresponds to the amount of pixels for the width of the detector, thus equals 2048 pixels. The precondition can be slightly violated, with the result that at TOMCAT, for an un-binned scan---which equals a detector width of 2048 pixels---1500 projection images are obtained for a sample rotation over \SI{180}{\degree}. In the binned case---where 2$\times$2 pixels are combined into one pixel, equaling a detector width of 1024 pixels---1000 projection images are recorded for one tomographic scan.

If we thus aim to enlarge the FOV of the tomographic images perpendicular to the rotation axis of the sample, it is not only necessary to stitch together several projection images, but it is also necessary to record more projections for the lateral parts of the sample compared to the central parts of the sample to be able to fulfill the sampling theorem. This leads to an increase in imaging and post-processing time as compared to a standard scan with a comparably smaller FOV. Let us assume that we have a sample that could be imaged using three overlapping FOVs of 1024 pixels, we have to obtain approximately 3000 projections in the lateral parts of the sample to fulfill the aforementioned sampling theorem\todo{Do we need to explain the sampling theorem in more depth?}.

During the development of the scanning protocols for the wide field scanning, we have seen that a small overlapping region between the separate subscans is necessary to be able to correctly stitch the single projection images from the subscans into one big projection (see section~\ref{subsec:covering a broad fov} for details). TOMCAT has the possibility to operate in the so called \SI{360}{\degree} mode, where a sample is scanned with full a full rotation, while the camera window only covers half of the sample dimensions (see figure~\ref{subfig:scanning-possibilities} for details). Afterwards, the projections are automatically stitched together and a full projection is formed. Preliminary results have shown, that using this \SI{360}{\degree}-scanning method was not viable for performing the wide field scans, even with precise calibration the outer scans could not be stitched together without introducing errors in the reconstruction. We would also have needed to introduce more processing steps like flipping of the projection images obtained in the second half of the rotation prior to stitching, so that we chose to only perform \SI{180}{\degree}-scans, but overlapping in such a sense that the outcome is equivalent to scanning with the \SI{360}{\degree}-method, except the projection images are obtained at three instead of two positions.

If we want to stitch together multiple subscans, \todo{sub scan, sub-scan or subscan?} we have to keep in mind that do not record an equal amount of projections for each of the subscans and thus need to make sure the stitching and concatenation into projections covering the desired full FOV is correctly performed.
