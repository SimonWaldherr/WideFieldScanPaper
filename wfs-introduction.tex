\section{Introduction\footnote{Author: \svnauthor; Revision: \svnrev; Last changed on: \svndate; URL: \url{\svnkw{HeadURL}}}}
\subsection{Background}
Synchrotron radiation based x-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) is a powerful method for the non-destructive three-dimensional imaging of a broad kind of materials with a resolution on the micrometer scale.

At TOMCAT -- the beamline for TOmographic Microscopy and Coherent rAdiology experimenTs~\cite{Stampanoni2007} at the Swiss Light Source at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland -- more than 20 user groups are presently working in very different research areas, ranging from biology, medicine and palaeontology to materials science, geology and process engineering. SRXTM enables the user to have a qualitative and quantitative measurement and analysis of nearly any structure.
