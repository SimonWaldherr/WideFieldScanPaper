\subsection{Image Merging and Reconstruction}\label{sec:Image Merging and Reconstruction}
Multiple independently acquired projection images covering the desired field of view were merged into single projections covering the full field of view. Figure~\ref{fig:wide field scan results}(a) shows corrected projection images from three overlapping subscans prior to merging (with marked overlapping regions). Figure~\ref{fig:wide field scan results}(b) shows one merged projection image prior to reconstruction and figure~\ref{fig:wide field scan results}(c) shows one slice of the reconstructed dataset of protocol B, acquired from 5244 projections. Such a reconstructed slice covers a field of view of 2792$\times$2792 pixels (4.13$\times$\SI{4.13}{\milli\meter}), which is almost three times the size of what can be achieved with one single binned scan (1024 pixels or \SI{1.52}{\milli\meter}). %1024 * 1.48 um/px = 1.51552mm
The dashed circles on the reconstructed slice mark the start and the end of the overlap region.

\subsection{Increasing the field of view}
The field of view of \SI{1.56}{\milli\meter}$\times$\SI{1.56}{\milli\meter} with a voxel size of \SI{0.74}{\micro\meter} at TOMCAT did permit visualizations of an entire acinus. Increasing the field of view by three times solved this limitation, allowing us to obtain three-dimensional reconstructions of full acini.

Figure~\ref{fig:s2-wfs} compares reconstructions of a conventional scan with reconstructions of a wide field scan. For a conventional scan (shown in fig.~\ref{fig:s2-wfs}(a)), the multiple acini in the sample are only partially contained inside the dataset (green and red airway segment). Increasing the field of view (fig.~\ref{fig:s2-wfs}(b)) allows the visualization of the full extent of those acini. Additionally, a third acinus (yellow) which is not visible inside the field of view of a conventional scan, can be visualized.

\subsection{Quality guided protocols}
\label{subsec:quality-guided-protocols}
Nineteen different protocols were defined (details see table~\ref{tab:protocols}). These protocols were linearly scaled in total amount of projections from an oversampled gold standard scan down to \SI{16}{\percent} of acquired projections. Choosing one of these protocols enables the end-user to perform a scan with reduced total time while still being able to reconstruct his or her sample in three-dimensions (as discussed later).

Protocol A would correspond to a gold standard scan covering the chosen field of view, with nine independent local tomography scans with a field of view of 1024$\times$1024 pixels each. This protocol was omitted from this study, since the sampling theorem can be equally satisfied by acquiring the required amount of projections with one central and two ring scans, as defined in section~\ref{subsubsec:reduction-of-acquisition-time}. Including an overlap of 100 pixels between the central and the ring scan, 13534 projections need to be acquired for the gold-standard protocol ($P_{A}=3(3072-200)\frac{\pi}{2}$).

Protocols C--T have been linearly scaled down with a decreasing percentage of acquired projections of the ring scans. As mentioned before, to facilitate the stitching of the individual projections, the amount of projections obtained for the central scan is reduced by a factor of two compared to the amount of projections recorded for the ring scans. As a consequence of the scaling and division by two, Protocol B actually corresponds to an oversampling of \SI{16}{\percent} as compared to a gold standard scan.

\begin{table}
	\caption{Specification of different protocols: Protocol A corresponds to the Gold Standard, and would be required to cover the field of view with 9 independent scans with a detector width of 1024 pixels (plus an overlap of 100 pixels), resulting in a number of projections $P_{A}=9*(1024-100)\ifhtml \pi/2 \else \frac{\pi}{2} \fi= 13020$. The gold standard wide field scanning protocol would correspond to covering the desired field of view with nine independent scans, resulting in a total number of projections of $P_{A} = 3(3072-200)\ifhtml \pi/2 \else \frac{\pi}{2} \fi= 13534$. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the datasets marked with a light gray background are shown in figure~\ref{fig:BvsT}.}%

\end{table}

A reduction of the total acquisition time by \SI{84}{\percent} compared to the gold standard was achieved, as shown in table~\ref{tab:protocols}. The same rat lung sample was batch-scanned with each of the 19 protocols. Three-dimensional reconstructions and visualizations have been made to assess the artifacts that arise through the reduction of the number of projections.

The performance of the protocols was been quantified using the difference image of binarized slices of the tomographic datasets, segmented according to%
\ifhtml%
	~\citet{Otsu1979}%
\else%
	~\citeasnoun{Otsu1979}%
\fi%
. The difference value ($E_{norm}$) plotted in figure~\ref{fig:NormalizedErrorPlot} was calculated for each protocol $i=$1--19 according to equations~\ref{eq:errorcalculation-a}--\ref{eq:errorcalculation-c}. Using a thresholded slice $k$ of each protocol $i$ ($Slice_{i_{k}}$) and the corresponding slice $k$ of the gold standard protocol $B$ ($Slice_{B_{i}}$) the absolute difference image ($D_{i_{k}}$) of these two slices $k$ was calculated. The sum of all pixels of this difference image yields a value ($E_{i_{norm_{k}}}$) for the difference of the examined slice $k$ of protocol $i$ with the corresponding slice of the gold standard protocol B.
\begin{eqnarray}%
	D_{i_{k}} &=& |Slice_{B_{k}}-Slice_{i_{k}}|\label{eq:errorcalculation-a}\\%
	E_{i_{norm_{k}}} &=& \sum_{x}\sum_{y} D_{i_{k}}\label{eq:errorcalculation-b}\\%
	E_{i_{norm}} &=& \overline{E_{i_{norm_{k}}}}\label{eq:errorcalculation-c}%
\end{eqnarray}%

This combined difference value ($E_{i_{norm_{k}}}$) was calculated for 205 regularly spaced slices (%
%$i=1:5:1024$%
every fifth slice%
) of the full dataset. The mean ($\overline{E_{i_{norm_{k}}}}$) difference value for all slices was normalized to the scanned quality-steps from 16.14--\SI{116.24}{\percent} (as stated in table~\ref{tab:protocols}) and plotted as max$(E_{norm}-E_{i_{norm}})$ with its standard deviation ($\sigma(E_{i_{norm_{k}}})$). The normalization and inversion was carried out to make the experimentally derived values (blue diamonds) directly comparable to the values obtained from the computed set of protocols (as specified in section~\ref{subsec:wfs-setup}, red dots).

As can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:NormalizedErrorPlot}, the calculated quality of the reconstructions from the different protocols decreases as amount of total obtained projections decreases, as expected. The calculated error of the different protocols, compared to a gold standard protocol (blue diamonds) shows experimental results not derived using simulations with a phantom, but rather real data obtained from actual scans of lung tissue. The plots for the simulation and the normalized difference value are not perfectly in agreement, but show the same trend. The simulation shows an exponential decrease in quality, while the calculated, normalized error shows a more linear decrease in quality from protocol B towards protocol T.

\subsubsection{three-dimensional visualization of different protocols}
\label{subsec:comparison}
x	The tomograms of the different protocols were three-dimensionally analyzed and visualized using MeVisLab (Version 2.0 (2009-06-09 Release), MeVis Medical Solutions AG and Fraunhofer MEVIS - Institute for Medical Image Computing, Bremen, Germany). Airway segments were extracted using a threshold interval based region growing algorithm. A seed point for the region growing algorithm was manually defined in the most proximal slice for each independent airway segment. The coordinates of the seed points were kept constant for protocol B--T, allowing direct comparison between the airway segment reconstructions of the different protocols. Airway segments extracted for protocol B, L and T are shown in figure~\ref{fig:BvsT}.

The data shown in figure~\ref{fig:BvsT} represent three of the 19 scanned protocols. Protocol B corresponds to a slightly oversampled gold standard scan, obtained with 15732 projections for all three subscans, recorded in \SI{66}{\minute}. Protocol L was obtained in \SI{35}{\minute} with total 7866 projections. Protocol T was obtained in \SI{12}{\minute} with total 2185 projections. The tomographic dataset from protocol B was reconstructed from 5244 merged projection images, the dataset from protocol L was reconstructed from 2622 merged projections and the dataset from protocol T was reconstructed using only 874 merged projections. Even though protocols L and T were scanned while violating the sampling theorem and with a total scanning time reduction of \SI{40}{\percent} (or more than \SI{86}{\percent}), the samples still appear to be identical to the gold standard protocol in the low-resolution three-dimensional visualization, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:BvsT}(a), (b) and (c).

Obviously, the artifacts introduced through the reduction in scanning time only become apparent at higher magnification. The blue cube inside the green airway segments in figures~\ref{fig:BvsT}(a), (b) and (c) are shown as isosurface visualizations of the lung tissue (which corresponds exactly to the negative of the extracted airway segment) in figures~\ref{fig:BvsT}(d), (e) and (f). The regions of interest show a cube with a side length of \SI{379}{\micro\meter} or 256 pixels.

Even with the higher magnification, the reconstruction of protocol L in figure~\ref{fig:BvsT}(e) appears nearly identical to the reconstruction of the region of interest of protocol B (fig.~\ref{fig:BvsT}(d)). The isosurface of the region of interest of protocol T shown in figure~\ref{fig:BvsT}(f) appears rougher than the isosurface of protocol B. This roughness is introduced through wave-like artifacts visible in the original slice of the dataset of protocol T (not shown). These artifacts arise through the breaching of the sampling theorem, since only 874 projections were acquired for the two ring-scans instead of the 5139 projections ($(3072-200)\frac{\pi}{2}$) required to satisfy the sampling theorem. However, even with this strong undersampling, segmentation, three-dimensional reconstruction and visualization of the sample is still possible.

For further analysis four regions of interest with a side length of 256 pixels (at \SI{1.48}{\micro\meter\per pixel}, thus containing a volume of \SI{1.678e7}{voxels}) have been extracted for each of the protocols B, L and T. The three-dimensional placement of these ROIs inside the sample is shown in figure~\ref{fig:roi3d}. Each of the ROIs has been binarized using an automatically determined threshold~\cite{Otsu1979} and small particles inside the segmented airspace lumen have been removed using a connected components analysis. Subsequently, the euclidean distance transformation has been calculated for each thresholded ROI.

For comparison, the histogram of the euclidean distance transformation has been plotted for all four regions of interest in each protocol (B, L and T).

Figure~\ref{fig:DTFplots} shows such a plot for each of the ROIs; the \textcolor{blue}{blue} plot shows the logarithmic histogram of the distance transformation of Protocol B, the \textcolor{green}{green} and \textcolor{red}{red} plot the same for protocols L and T, respectively. For all four regions of interest the distribution of the euclidean distance transformation is very similar, only for larger airway diameters (approx. \SI{3e-2}{\milli\meter}) in the regions of interest 3 and 4 we see a discernible difference. The histogram is plotted with a logarithmic y-axis, so the difference of the histograms is only visible for several hundred voxels. Thus, even if we reduce the sample acquisition time down to \SI{16}{\percent} of the gold-standard scan (B vs.\ T), both histograms of the distance transformation are very similar. From this we can claim that no relevant structural differences are introduced through the reduction in scanning time and undersampling for the dosage-reduced protocols.

Thus, if the user desires to gain a quick overview over his or her sample at a high resolution, e.g.\ to quickly assess the integrity of multiple samples over a short time, such a time-saving protocol could be used. It has to be mentioned that a quick overview could---in principle---also be obtained with a low-resolution scan, which usually automatically accommodates a larger field of view. However, the resolution of such an overview scan would not be sufficient to detect interesting features in the samples.

If the end-user desires to have a tomographic scan at high resolution and large field of view, but strives to reduce the radiation dose inflicted on the sample, we now provide the possibility to perform such a scan during a reduced time in a semi-automated, objective way.

The field of view can be increased even further than three times; we also scanned and reconstructed a rat lung sample with 5 scanning positions, resulting in a five-fold (4.74$\times$) increase in available field of view from 1024$\times$1024 pixels to 4852$\times$4852 pixels (data not shown). We have been able to reconstruct a sample with a size of 0.82$\times$7.18$\times$\SI{1.52}{\milli\meter} %(cropped from 4852$\times$4852$\times$1024 down to 552$\times$4852$\times$1024 pixels) 
at a voxel side length of \SI{1.48}{\micro\meter}.
