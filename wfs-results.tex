\subsection{Image Merging and Reconstruction}\label{sec:Image Merging and Reconstruction}
Multiple independently acquired projection images covering the desired field of view were merged into single projections covering the full field of view. Figure~\ref{fig:wide-field-scan-results}(a) shows corrected projection images from three overlapping subscans prior to merging including marked regions where the subscans are overlapping. Figure~\ref{fig:wide-field-scan-results}(b) shows one merged projection image prior to reconstruction and figure~\ref{fig:wide-field-scan-results}(c) shows one slice of the reconstructed dataset of protocol B, acquired from 5244 projections. Such a reconstructed slice covers a field of view of 2792$\times$2792 pixels (4.13$\times$\SI{4.13}{\milli\meter}), which is almost three times the size of what can be achieved with one single binned scan (1024 pixels or \SI{1.52}{\milli\meter}). %1024 * 1.48 um/px = 1.51552mm
The dashed circles on the reconstructed slice mark the start and the end of the overlap region.

			(a) Three corrected and independently acquired projection images from subscans $s_1$--$s_3$, each with a size of 1024\(\times\)1024 pixels at a resolution of \SI{1.48}{\micro\meter} per pixel, each covering a field of view of \SI{1.52}{\milli\meter}. Subscans $s_1$ and $s_2$ overlap each other by 141 pixels (red and green overlay), subscans $s_2$ and $s_3$ overlap each other by 138 pixels (blue and yellow overlay). 5244 projections over a rotation of \SI{180}{\degree} have been acquired for all subscans. %
			(b) Merged projection obtained from the three subscans shown in subfigure (a). Each merged projection has a size of 2793\(\times\)1024 pixels at a pixel size of \SI{1.48}{\micro\meter}. The width of the merged projections is slightly smaller than three times the width of the subscans, due to the overlap required to merge the projections (2793px=3072px-141px-138px). %
			(c) Cropped slice of the tomographic dataset, reconstructed from 5244 merged projections shown in subfigure b). The dashed red circles mark the start and end of the overlap region. Due to the coherence of the x-ray beam, the air-to-paraffin interface is visible around the sample.}

\subsection{Increasing the field of view}
The field of view of \SI{1.52}{\milli\meter}$\times$\SI{1.52}{\milli\meter} with a voxel size of \SI{0.74}{\micro\meter} at TOMCAT did not permit visualizations of an entire acinus. Increasing the field of view by three times solved this limitation, allowing us to obtain three-dimensional reconstructions of full acini.

Figure~\ref{fig:s2-wfs} compares isosurface reconstructions of airway segments obtained with a conventional scan with isosurface reconstructions obtained with a wide field scan. For a conventional scan (shown in fig.~\ref{fig:s2-wfs}(a)), the multiple independent airway segments in the sample are only partially contained inside the dataset (green and red segment). Increasing the field of view (fig.~\ref{fig:s2-wfs}(b)) allows the visualization of the full extent of those acini. Additionally, a third acinus (yellow) which is not visible inside the field of view of a conventional scan, can be visualized.

\subsection{Quality guided protocols}
\label{subsec:quality-guided-protocols}
Nineteen different protocols were defined (details see table~\ref{tab:protocols}). These protocols were linearly scaled in total amount of projections from an oversampled gold standard scan down to \SI{16}{\percent} of acquired total projections. Choosing one of these protocols enables the end-user to perform a scan with reduced total time while still being able to reconstruct his or her sample in three-dimensions (as discussed later).

Protocol A would correspond to a gold standard scan covering the chosen field of view, with nine independent local tomography scans with a field of view of 1024$\times$1024 pixels each. This protocol was omitted from this study, since the sampling theorem can be equally satisfied by acquiring the required amount of projections with one central and two ring scans, as defined in section~\ref{subsubsec:reduction-of-acquisition-time}. Including an overlap of 100 pixels between the central and the ring scan, 13534 projections need to be acquired for the gold-standard protocol ($P_{A}=3(3072-200)\frac{\pi}{2}$).

Protocols C--T have been linearly scaled down with a decreasing percentage of acquired projections of the ring scans. As mentioned before, to facilitate the stitching of the individual projections, the amount of projections obtained for the central scan is reduced by a factor of two compared to the amount of projections recorded for the ring scans. As a consequence of the constraints in scaling and division by two, Protocol B actually corresponds to an oversampling of \SI{16}{\percent} as compared to a gold standard scan.

\begin{table}
	\caption{Specification of different protocols: Protocol A corresponds to the Gold Standard, and would be required to cover the field of view with 9 independent scans with a detector width of 1024 pixels (plus an overlap of 100 pixels), resulting in a number of projections $P_{A}=9*(1024-100)\ifhtml \pi/2 \else \frac{\pi}{2} \fi= 13020$. The gold standard wide field scanning protocol would correspond to covering the desired field of view with nine independent scans, resulting in a total number of projections of $P_{A} = 3(3072-200)\ifhtml \pi/2 \else \frac{\pi}{2} \fi= 13534$. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the datasets marked with a light gray background are shown in figure~\ref{fig:BvsT}.

A reduction of the total acquisition time by \SI{84}{\percent} compared to the gold standard was achieved, as shown in table~\ref{tab:protocols}. The same rat lung sample was batch-scanned with each of the 19 protocols. Three-dimensional reconstructions and visualizations have been computed to assess the artifacts that arise through the reduction of the number of projections.

The performance of the protocols was been quantified using the difference image of binarized slices of the tomographic datasets, segmented according to%
\ifhtml%
	~\citet{Otsu1979}%
\else%
	~\citeasnoun{Otsu1979}%
\fi%
. The difference value ($E_{norm}$) plotted in figure~\ref{fig:NormalizedErrorPlot} was calculated for each protocol $i=$1--19 according to equations~\ref{eq:errorcalculation-a}--\ref{eq:errorcalculation-c}. Using a thresholded slice $k$ of each protocol $i$ ($Slice_{i_{k}}$) and the corresponding slice $k$ of the gold standard protocol $B$ ($Slice_{B_{i}}$) the absolute difference image ($D_{i_{k}}$) of these two slices $k$ was calculated. The sum of all pixels of this difference image yields a value ($E_{i_{norm_{k}}}$) for the difference of the examined slice $k$ of protocol $i$ with the corresponding slice of the gold standard protocol B.
\begin{eqnarray}%
	D_{i_{k}} &=& |Slice_{B_{k}}-Slice_{i_{k}}|\label{eq:errorcalculation-a}\\%
	E_{i_{norm_{k}}} &=& \sum_{x}\sum_{y} D_{i_{k}}\label{eq:errorcalculation-b}\\%
	E_{i_{norm}} &=& \overline{E_{i_{norm_{k}}}}\label{eq:errorcalculation-c}%
\end{eqnarray}%

This combined difference value ($E_{i_{norm_{k}}}$) was calculated for 205 regularly spaced slices (%
%$i=1:5:1024$%
every fifth slice%
) of the full dataset. The mean ($\overline{E_{i_{norm_{k}}}}$) difference value for all slices was normalized to the scanned quality-steps from 16.14--\SI{116.24}{\percent} (as stated in table~\ref{tab:protocols}) and plotted as max$(E_{norm}-E_{i_{norm}})$ with its standard deviation ($\sigma(E_{i_{norm_{k}}})$). The normalization and inversion was carried out to make the experimentally derived values (blue diamonds) directly comparable to the values obtained from the computed set of protocols (as specified in section~\ref{subsec:wfs-setup}, red dots).

As can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:NormalizedErrorPlot}, the calculated quality of the reconstructions from the different protocols decreases as amount of total obtained projections decreases, as expected. The calculated error of the different protocols, compared to a gold standard protocol (blue diamonds) shows experimental results not derived using simulations with a phantom, but rather real data obtained from actual scans of lung tissue. The plots for the simulation and the normalized difference value are not perfectly in agreement, but show the same trend. The simulation shows an exponential decrease in quality, while the calculated, normalized error shows a more linear decrease in quality from protocol B towards protocol T.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\caption{Plot of normalized difference Value ($E_{i_{norm}}$, blue diamonds) for the 19 scanned protocols overlaid over Quality-plot (red dots) obtained from the simulation. The normalized Error has been calculated using the difference image of each protocol $i$ with protocol B. The error bars for each protocol show the standard deviation of the error calculated for 205 of the 1024 slices. Note that the scale of the error was normalized to 20--\SI{100}{\percent}, so that both the quality from the simulation and the error are directly comparable. The abscissa shows the scanning time in percentage of time used for the gold standard scan. Protocol T corresponds to the fastest scanning time, protocol B to the slowest. The protocols in between are shown in decreasing order from T--B for increasing percentage of the scanning time.}

\subsubsection{Three-dimensional visualization of different protocols}
\label{subsec:comparison}
The tomograms of the different protocols were three-dimensionally analyzed and visualized using MeVisLab (Version 2.0 (2009-06-09 Release), MeVis Medical Solutions AG and Fraunhofer MEVIS - Institute for Medical Image Computing, Bremen, Germany). Airway segments were extracted using a threshold interval based region growing algorithm. A seed point for the region growing algorithm was manually defined in the most proximal slice for each independent airway segment. The coordinates of the seed points were kept constant for protocol B--T, allowing direct comparison between the airway segment reconstructions of the different protocols. Airway segments extracted for protocol B, L and T are shown in figure~\ref{fig:BvsT}.

The three-dimensional isosurface visualizations shown in figure~\ref{fig:BvsT} represent three of the 19 scanned protocols. Protocol B corresponds to a slightly oversampled gold standard scan, obtained with total 15732 projections, recorded in \SI{66}{\minute}. Protocol L was obtained in \SI{35}{\minute} with total 7866 projections. Protocol T was obtained in \SI{12}{\minute} with 2185 projections for all three subscans. The tomographic dataset from protocol B was reconstructed from 5244 merged projection images, the dataset from protocol L was reconstructed from 2622 merged projections and the dataset from protocol T was reconstructed using only 874 merged projections. Even though protocols L and T were scanned while violating the sampling theorem and with a total scanning time reduction of \SI{40}{\percent} (or more than \SI{86}{\percent}), the samples still appear to be identical to the gold standard protocol in the low-resolution three-dimensional visualizations shown in figure~\ref{fig:BvsT}(a), (b) and (c).

Obviously, the artifacts introduced through the reduction in scanning time only become apparent at higher magnification. The blue cube inside the green airway segments in figures~\ref{fig:BvsT}(a), (b) and (c) are shown as isosurface visualizations of the lung tissue (which corresponds exactly to the negative of the extracted airway segment) in figures~\ref{fig:BvsT}(d), (e) and (f). The regions of interest show a cube with a side length of \SI{379}{\micro\meter} or 256 pixels.

Even with the higher magnification, the reconstruction of protocol L in figure~\ref{fig:BvsT}(e) appears nearly identical to the reconstruction of the region of interest of protocol B (fig.~\ref{fig:BvsT}(d)). The isosurface of the region of interest of protocol T shown in figure~\ref{fig:BvsT}(f) appears rougher than the isosurface of protocol B. This roughness is introduced through wave-like artifacts visible in the original slice of the dataset of protocol T (not shown). These artifacts arise through the breaching of the sampling theorem, since only 874 projections were acquired for the two ring-scans instead of the 5139 projections ($(3072-200)\frac{\pi}{2}$) required to satisfy the sampling theorem. However, even with this strong undersampling, segmentation, three-dimensional reconstruction and visualization of the sample is still possible.

Figure~\ref{fig:DTFplots} shows logarithmic plots for each of the histogram distributions for each of the four selected ROIs; the \textcolor{blue}{blue} plot shows the histogram of the distance transformation of Protocol B, the \textcolor{green}{green} and \textcolor{red}{red} plot the same for protocols L and T, respectively. For all four regions of interest the distribution of the euclidean distance transformation is very similar, only for larger airway diameters (approx. \SI{30}{\micro\meter}) we see a discernible difference in the regions of interest 3 and 4. If we remember that the histogram is plotted with a logarithmic y-axis, we see that the difference of the histograms is only visible for several hundred voxels. Thus, even if we reduce the sample acquisition time down to \SI{16}{\percent} of the gold-standard scan (B vs.\ T), both histograms of the distance transformation are very similar. We thus claim that no relevant structural differences are introduced through the reduction in scanning time and undersampling for the dosage-reduced protocols.

To assess this claim, we additionally scanned a rat lung sample with four different protocols (A, B, C and D, details see table~\ref{tab:abcd}). After acquisition of those four protocols, we artificially reduced the amount of projections of the central subscan. After merging these different sets of projections to in total 16 different datasets we reconstructed all those datasets for a more thorough analysis of the differences introduced through the reduction in amount of projections for the central subscan.

We assessed the structural similarity index \cite{Wang2004} of every 35\textsuperscript{th} slice of the dataset in comparison to the protocol with the maximal amount of acquired projections for this experiment (A)\footnote{The normalized error (as shown in figure~\ref{fig:NormalizedErrorPlot}) has also been calculated and shows comparable results.}). As can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:ssimplot}, the structural similarity index (SSIM) greatly decreases for a reduced amount of projections of the central subscan. Halving the projections of the central subscan reduces the SSIM for protocol A$\frac{\textrm{Central}}{2}$ (12600 total projections) lower than the quality of the unreduced protocol C (12096 total projections). Reducing the central subscan down to 630 projections (A$\frac{\textrm{Central}}{8}$, 10710 total projections), the quality of the reconstructions drops to the quality of the unreduced scan D (total 10584 projections).

Additionally, we have been able to increase the field of view even further; we also scanned and reconstructed a rat lung sample with 5 scanning positions, resulting in a five-fold (4.74$\times$) increase in available field of view from 1024$\times$1024 pixels to 4852$\times$4852 pixels (reconstructions not shown). We have been able to reconstruct a sample with a size of 0.82$\times$7.18$\times$\SI{1.52}{\milli\meter} %(cropped from 4852$\times$4852$\times$1024 down to 552$\times$4852$\times$1024 pixels)
