\section{Results}
Results of the aforementioned steps are shown in figure~\ref{fig:wide field scan}. Figure~\ref{subfig:wfs-sub} shows exemplary projection images from overlapping subscans prior to correction and normalization. Figure~\ref{subfig:wfs-mrg} shows a merged projection image prior to reconstruction and figure~\ref{subfig:wfs-slice} shows the end-result of such a wide field scan, a reconstructed slice of the whole sample with a FOV of \unit{5.734}{\milli\meter} --- approximately five times the size of what can be achieved with one single scan.
