\section{Results}
Results of the aforementioned steps are shown in figure~\ref{fig:wide field scan}. Figure~\ref{subfig:wfs-sub} shows exemplary projection images from overlapping subscans prior to correction and normalization. Figure~\ref{subfig:wfs-mrg} shows a merged projection image prior to reconstruction and figure~\ref{subfig:wfs-slice} shows the end-result of such a wide field scan, a reconstructed slice of the whole sample with a FOV of \unit{5.734}{\milli\meter} --- approximately three times the size of what can be achieved with one single scan.

	\subfloat[Merged and corrected projection composed from the three subscans shown in \subref{subfig:wfs-sub}. The images have been corrected with the flat image shown in~\ref{subfig:flat}, the correct cutting line has been calculated, and the images have been merged into one big projection image. This merged projection has a size of \numprint{2994}$\times$\numprint{1024} pixels. This particular sample consists of \numprint{4678} such projection images (see section~\ref{subsec:image processing} for details). A slice reconstructed from a set of merged projections like this one is shown in \subref{subfig:wfs-slice}.]{
